  cv2.waitKey(5000)        === 5 second delay for pic.
  cv2.destroyAllWindows()  === All windows closed using this keyword.
  cv2.destroyWindows()     === Using this only particular windows we can destroy.
  cv2.waitKey(0)           === 0 means picture never disaapear without click on delete window. its stay permanently on running windows.
